# 🎉 You're All Set! Here's How to Run Your Tests

## ✅ What's Working

Your WDIO + TypeScript + Appium setup is complete and working! The app launching and closing is **normal behavior** - the test completes and closes the app at the end.

## 🚀 Run Your Tests

### Option 1: Use the Run Script (Easiest)

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

This script will:
- Set up Android environment variables
- Check for connected devices
- Run your tests

### Option 2: Manual Run

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
npm test
```

## 📱 What You'll See

When you run the tests, you'll see:

1. **App launches** on your emulator (money.super.apk)
2. **Test runs** for ~20 seconds (10 seconds per test)
3. **App closes** when test completes (this is normal!)

The output will show:
```
✅ Current package: <your.app.package>
✅ Current activity: <MainActivity>
✅ Screen size: {"width":1080,"height":2340}
✅ App launched successfully!
```

## 🎯 Understanding the Test

Your current test (`src/specs/first-test.ts`) does:

1. **Launches the app** - Opens money.super.apk
2. **Waits 5 seconds** - For app to fully load
3. **Gets device info** - Package, activity, screen size
4. **Verifies app is running** - Checks it launched successfully
5. **Keeps app open 10 seconds** - So you can see it
6. **Verifies accessibility** - Gets page source
7. **Closes the session** - Normal completion

## ⏸️ How to Keep App Open Longer

If you want the app to stay open longer, edit `src/specs/first-test.ts`:

```typescript
// Change these numbers to seconds you want to wait
await driver.pause(10000); // Currently 10 seconds
```

Or add at the end of your test:

```typescript
after(() => {
  console.log('⏸️ Keeping app open for 30 seconds...');
  await driver.pause(30000); // 30 seconds
});
```

## 📸 Taking Screenshots

Screenshots are already configured! They'll save to `screenshots/` when:
- Tests fail
- You manually capture them

To take a screenshot in your test:
```typescript
await driver.saveScreenshot('./screenshots/my-screenshot.png');
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

### 1. Add More Tests

Create `src/specs/my-interaction-test.ts`:

```typescript
import { expect } from '@wdio/globals';

describe('My App Interactions', () => {
  it('should interact with buttons', async () => {
    await driver.pause(3000);
    
    // Find and click elements
    // Example: await driver.$('~button-id').click();
    
    // Verify results
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Then add to `wdio.conf.ts` specs array.

### 2. Find Elements

Use Appium Inspector to find element selectors:
```bash
appium inspector
```

### 3. Use Helper Functions

Import from `src/utils/helpers.ts`:
```typescript
import { waitForElement, clickByText } from '../utils/helpers';

await clickByText('Sign In');
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### App closes too quickly?
The app closing after tests is normal. If you want it to stay open longer, increase the `await driver.pause()` values in your test.

### Want to keep app open permanently?
Remove the appium:noReset and appium:fullReset options from `wdio.conf.ts` capabilities.

### Need to see what's happening?
Check the console output - it will show emoji indicators:
- ⏳ Waiting
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Error
- 🔍 Checking

## 🎉 Success!

Your Android automation is working perfectly! The app launching and closing is the expected behavior when tests complete successfully.
